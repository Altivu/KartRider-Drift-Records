      <p>Welcome to the Unofficial KartRider Drift Records website.</p>
      <p>This website was created to make it easier to find track information, as well as videos to records for those tracks.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Note that this website is not necessarily meant to track "world records", but more as a reference for how other players run particular tracks. It is very likely that the fastest records in general will not have been video recorded, and there is (currently) no in-game replay feature, which makes it beneficial to consult gameplay videos of the player's point of view.</p>
      <br />
      You can sign in with a Google account to help contribute to the records list, as well as keep track of your own records.
